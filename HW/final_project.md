# 1. Project Assignment 

## 1.1 Objective: 

This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience of applying Python programming skills in environmental and water resources data analysis. It emphasizes practical application, critical thinking, and independent learning.

## 1.2 Project Description:

You will be required to develop a research question or an industry-oriented problem related to environmental issues or water resources. Then, you will use Python and its various libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data to answer your research question or solve the problem. The project will be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students.

## 1.3 Your project should demonstrate your ability to:

- Utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Xarray, and Catropy
- Access, manage, analyze, visualize, and share data from various sources
- Perform spatial analysis using platforms and tools like Google Earth Engine, USGS ScienceBasePy, and FloPy
- Execute a project using Python, encompassing data analysis, and visualization to address environmental and water resources challenges

## 1.4 Project Schedule & Assessment:

To ensure the project is appropriately challenging, schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss your proposed project and obtain approval. Meetings are typically around 15 minutes, but may be extended as needed. You need to obtain approval before you submit your project abstract. You can schedule a meeting with the instructor during office hourse on Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00 to 12:pm and from 3:00 pm to 4:15 pm, or after the class.

Due dates will be posted on Canvas. The project will be graded according to the following schedule:
- 10% Project Abstract : Outline of the proposed research question or problem, methodology, and expected outcomes
- 10% Interim Report : Progress report detailing the work done so far, preliminary results, and any challenges encountered
- 20% Project Presentation : Presentation of your project findings to the class
- 10% Peer-Assessment : Evaluation of your contribution and your team members' contributions to the project (for group projects only)
- 60% Final Report : Comprehensive report detailing your methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions

Note: For groups of two or three students, a [peer-assessment rubric](#-Instructions:) is provided to evaluate the contribution of each member. However, even if you are working individually, you still need to submit the Peer Assessment Form as instructed [below](#-Submission-Instructions:) for grading purposes. 


## 1.5 Support:

Bear in mind that the instructor is available to provide any needed guidance and support. You're encouraged to seek help when necessary and to actively discuss your project with the instructor.

## 1.6 Submission:

All submission dates will be posted on Canvas. Please ensure that your work is submitted on time. Late submissions may result in a reduction of marks.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your creative applications of Python in environmental data science!

## 3. FAQ 

### Project idea 

**In case I do not have a project idea, how can I find a one?**   
   
The key is to choose a project that aligns with your interests and allows you to demonstrate your skills in Python and environmental data analysis. Here are few suggestions:
- Identify personal interests or environmental challenges specific to your local area
- Explore available datasets from sources like USGS, Google Earth Engine, CMIP6, Data.GOV Database, etc. 
- Reproduce a research paper, and you can find many research papers at different sources such as a [special issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/22582/rapid-reproducible-and-robust-environmental-modeling-for-decision-support-worked-examples-and-open-source-software-tools/articles) or a [jounral](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) about environmental data science. 
- Leverage on an existing project such the as environmental projects on [Environmental Data Driven Inquiry and Exploration (Eddie)](https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie)
- Check tutorials such as [NASA Gesdisc Tutorials](https://github.com/nasa/gesdisc-tutorials) or cookbooks such as [Geo-Python](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io) to get ideas 
- Leverage on a project that you currently doing at work or working on with your supervisor 
- Reach out to local environmental organizations or agencies and they may have data or specific problems that you could address using your skills. For example, contact the [Director of Community Engagement at FGCU Service-Learning team](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/servicelearning/aboutus#OurTeam) and he will pair you with a local organization that suits your interest.
- Analyze climate data, predict trends, or assess the potential consequences on water resources, specific ecosystem, etc. 
- Explore projects related to water resources, such as analyzing groundwater levels, assessing water quality, etc.  
- Analyze data related to air in a specific region and explore ways to visualize and interpret the findings
- Assess environmental impact of a specific community or industry by analyzing data related to emissions, waste management, resource consumption, etc.
- Study datata sets that are traditional non-related such as urban water lake quality and real estate prices 
Feel free to combine multiple ideas or customize them to suit your preferences. If in doubt, consult with your instructor for guidance and approval.
