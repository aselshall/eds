## Evaluation of downscaled climate data for South Florida

Faulty member: Mewcha A. Gebremedhin, Ph.D.
Funding: EPA-I-R4-SFL-2023-01; 2023 South Florida Program

### 1. Project overview

This project aims to download, process, and evaluate downscaled climate data from multiple Global Climate Models (GCMs) for South Florida. The evaluation will compare the climate data against in-situ observations using statistical metrics and graphical analyses to determine the best-performing climate models.

### 2. Project objectives

- Download downscaled climate datasets from multiple sources (dynamical and statistical downscaling methods).
- Process and evaluate the accuracy of the climate datasets against in-situ observations.
- Use statistical metrics for evaluation.
- Present findings through statistical and graphical analyses.
- Identify the best-performing climate models.
Â· Publish the Python code and final report on GitHub and/or another platform.

### 3. Data acquisition

Identify and select multiple downscaled climate datasets for South Florida from sources such as:
- CMIP6-based Multi-model Hydroclimate Projection over the Conterminous US: [Link](https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov/dataset/9d3ff396-992d-5bd7-ab02-d21ec6193147)
- CMIP6 downscaled data (e.g., through CORDEX or other regional initiatives): [Link](https://cordex.org/experiment-guidelines/cordex-cmip6)
- Use Python to download the datasets via APIs or direct file access

### 4. Data processing
- Extract the important baseline and future climate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, sea- level rise) for South Florida.
- Handle missing values and ensure temporal alignment with in-situ observations.
- Statistical and graphical evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the climate variables from multiple climate models compared to the in-situ data using metrics like:
  - Correlation Coefficient (r).
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Use Python to visualize and analyze results.
- Generate evaluation graphs like maps, scatter and time-series plots to compare datasets.

### 5. Results and discussion
- Summarize evaluation results in tabular and/or graphical forms.
- Discuss findings, highlighting the best-performing models and future climate implications
- Interpret the implications of model performance for future climate impact studies in South Florida

### 6. Report writing and submission

Prepare a final report in the following the [final report format](https://aselshall.github.io/eds/HW/project#13-schedule-and-assessment)
