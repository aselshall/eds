## 1. Project Assignment 

### 1.1 Project Description

You are expected to conduct a project using Python on a water or environmental issue of your choice. You should develop a research question or problem statement that guides your analysis. You need to use Python and its various libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data to answer your research question or solve the industry-oriented problem. The project can be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students. Throughout the project, you will have the opportunity to apply and deepen your skills in data analysis and visualization, critical thinking, and independent learning, in alignment with the project objectives.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

Your project should demonstrate your ability to perform the following tasks.
1. **Environmental data analysis and visualization:** Conduct a project using Python, encompassing data analysis, and visualization to address a water or environmental issue of your choice
2. **Research question/problem statement:** Develop a research question or problem statement that guides your analysis 
3. **Data acquisition and processing:** Skillfully access, manage, wrangle, and analyze complex datasets with diverse data formats and from diverse sources such as Google Earth Engine, USGS ScienceBasePy, NOAA, Data.Gov, peer-reviewed articles, among others
4. **Python libraries and tools:** Apply appropriate Python libraries and tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, such as Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Xarray, Cartopy, Geemap, FloPy, and TensorFlow
5.  **Result evaluation and interpretation:** Critically evaluate and interpret the results of your analysis, and draw meaningful conclusions that address your original research question or problem statement
6. **Data communication:** Effectively communicate your findings by documenting, visualizing, sharing and presenting your data insights in a clear and concise manner utilizing tools such as Jupyter notebook, GitHub, and Binder 
7. **Code documentation and best practices**: Deliver clear and well-documented Jupyter notebook with Python codes following the best coding practices
8. **Reporitng**: Deliver a technically proficient final report following recognized academic or professional standards
9. **Presentation:** Deliver a clear, organized, and effective class presentation to disseminate the project's findings to a wider audience
10. **Team collaboration**: If applicable, contribute meaningfully to the project, and demonstrate effective teamwork skills including communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution


### 1.3 Schedule and Assessment

To ensure the project is appropriately challenging, schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss your proposed project and obtain approval. Meetings are typically around 15 minutes, but may be extended as needed. You need to obtain approval before you submit your project abstract. You need to schedule a meeting with the instructor during office hourse on Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00 to 12:pm and from 3:00 pm to 4:15 pm, or after the class.

Due dates for the following deliverables will be posted on Canvas. The project will be graded according to the following schedule:
- **Peer-Assessment (10%)** : Evaluation of your contribution and your team members' contributions to the project, if applicable
- **Project Abstract ((10%)** : Two-page abstract outlining the proposed research question or industry-oriented problem, methodology, plan for implementation, and expected outcomes
- **Interim Report (10%)** : Progress report detailing the work done so far, preliminary results, and any challenges encountered
- **Final Report (50%)** : Comprehensive report detailing your methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions
- **Project Presentation (20%)** : Presentation of your project findings to the class

The due dates of the above deliverables will be posted on Canvas.

### 1.4 Support

The instructor is available to provide any needed guidance and support. You are encouraged to seek help when necessary and to actively discuss your project with the instructor.

### 1.5 Submission

Submission dates will be posted on Canvas. Please ensure that your work is submitted on time. Late submissions will result in 10% deduction per day up to 50%. 

All students need to submit the peer-assessment. You only get the peer-assessment grade if you submitted peer-assessment. 
- If you are working in a group, use peer-assessment rubric below to evaluate the contribution of each member
- If you are working individually, for Canvas grading purposes, submit a document stating that you are working individually 

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your creative applications in water and environmental data science with Python.

## 2. Rubrics 

The rubrics serve as a general guide to understand the evaluation criteria and expectations. The rubrics are subject to change to the benefit of the students. The rubrics may be adjusted based on student feedback to ensure a more relevant and engaging learning experience.

## 3. FAQ 

The instructor will regularly update this section throughout the project to answer common questions and clarify any uncertainties that students may have.

### Are there any project themes or topics that we are restricted to?

While there is no strict limitation on project themes, your chosen topic should fall under the broader umbrella of water and environmental data science. This includes, but is not limited to, areas such as environmental science, ecological studies, hydrology, environmental engineering, climate change impacts, environmental economics, demographic changes, public health concerns, social media discourse, and social sciences research, all with a focus on water or environmental issues. Your project should demonstrate the application of Python for data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving in these interconnected fields.

### In case I do not have a project idea, how can I find a one?   

The key is to choose a project that aligns with your interests and allows you to demonstrate your skills in Python and water and environmental data analysis. To get project ideas you can:
- **Your current work**: Leverage on a project that you currently doing at work, working on with your supervisor, or for your graduation
- **Explore datasets**: Explore available datasets from various sources such as [Data.Gov](https://data.gov), [NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/), [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/browse), [copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/accessing-data-where-and-how/copernicus-services-catalogue), [USGS](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/), Tax data: [SOI Tax Stats - Data by Geographic Area](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-data-by-geographic-area), and Kaggle Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects: [Kaggle csv data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv) to generate creative project ideas.
- **Research papers**: Explore research papers from an [environmental data science journal](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) or a [special issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/22582/rapid-reproducible-and-robust-environmental-modeling-for-decision-support-worked-examples-and-open-source-software-tools/articles)
- **Build on existing projects**: Leverage on an existing project such the as environmental projects on [Environmental Data Driven Inquiry and Exploration (Eddie)](https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie), tutorials from [NASA Gesdisc](https://github.com/nasa/gesdisc-tutorials), or [cookbooks from Project Pythia](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/)
- **Local concerns**: Identify an environmental problem specific to your local area that aligns with your interests or reach out to local environmental organizations or agencies. For example, contact the [Director of Community Engagement at FGCU Service-Learning team](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/servicelearning/aboutus#OurTeam) and he will pair you with a local organization that suits your interest
- **Seek Guidance**: Consult with your instructor, who may have suggestions for tailored project ideas that suit your interests and learning goals.
