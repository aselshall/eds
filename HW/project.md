Project Assignment

## Objective: 

This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience of applying Python programming skills in environmental and water resources data analysis. It emphasizes practical application, critical thinking, and independent learning.

## Project Description:

You will be required to develop a research question or an industry-oriented problem related to environmental issues or water resources. Then, you will use Python and its various libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data to answer your research question or solve the problem. The project will be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students.

## Your project should demonstrate your ability to:

- Utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Xarray, and Catropy.
- Access, manage, analyze, visualize, and share environmental data from various sources.
- Perform spatial analysis of environmental and water resources data using platforms and tools like Google Earth Engine, USGS ScienceBasePy, and FloPy.
- Analyze climate change data using CMIP6 datasets.
- Execute a project using Python, encompassing data analysis, and visualization to address environmental and water resources challenges.


## Project Schedule & Assessment:

The project will be graded according to the following schedule:

Project Abstract – 10% (Due dates will be posted on Canvas)
- Outline of the proposed research question or problem, methodology, and expected outcomes.

Interim Report – 10% (Due dates will be posted on Canvas)
- Progress report detailing the work done so far, preliminary results, and any challenges encountered.

Project Presentation – 20% (Due dates will be posted on Canvas)
- Presentation of your project findings to the class.

Peer-Assessment – 10% (Due dates will be posted on Canvas)
- Evaluation contribution of each member to the projec (for group project only)

Final Report – 50% (Due dates will be posted on Canvas)
- Comprehensive report detailing your methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions.

Note: For groups of two or three students, a peer-assessment rubric will be provided to evaluate the contribution of each member.

## Support:

Bear in mind that the instructor is available to provide any needed guidance and support. You're encouraged to seek help when necessary and to actively discuss your project with the instructor.

## Submission:

All submission dates will be posted on Canvas. Please ensure that your work is submitted on time. Late submissions may result in a reduction of marks.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your creative applications of Python in environmental data science!
