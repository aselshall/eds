## Five-Level Critical Thinking Performance Metric*

A strong metric for measuring critical thinking should capture how you reason, evaluate evidence, question assumptions, and justify decisions. This is research-based 5-level metric adapted from well-established higher-education rubrics (AAC&U VALUE Rubric, Facione’s critical thinking framework, and engineering reasoning rubrics). 

### **Level 5 – Sophisticated / Advanced Reasoner**

* Identifies problems with depth and nuance.
* Evaluates evidence critically, recognizing limitations, uncertainty, and tradeoffs.
* Integrates diverse sources into a coherent, original argument.
* Consistently questions assumptions (their own and others’) and defends decisions with strong justification.
* Demonstrates metacognition: explains *how* and *why* they chose an approach.

### **Level 4 – Strong / Competent Reasoner**

* Clearly defines the problem and its context.
* Uses credible evidence and explains why sources are trustworthy.
* Compares alternative explanations or solutions with thoughtful judgment.
* Acknowledges assumptions and limitations.
* Justifies decisions effectively but with less depth or originality than Level 5.

### **Level 3 – Functional / Developing Reasoner**

* Defines the problem but may oversimplify or omit context.
* Uses evidence but inconsistently evaluates its quality.
* Recognizes alternatives but may not weigh them rigorously.
* Identifies obvious assumptions but misses deeper ones.
* Reasoning is generally logical but not fully articulated or justified.

### **Level 2 – Emerging / Limited Reasoner**

* Problem definition is unclear, narrow, or incomplete.
* Relies on unexamined or weak evidence.
* Rarely considers alternative explanations or solutions.
* Assumptions go unrecognized.
* Justifications are superficial or based on opinion rather than analysis.

### **Level 1 – Beginning / Minimal Reasoner**

* Does not clearly identify the problem or purpose.
* Uses little to no evidence, or accepts information uncritically.
* Provides no meaningful evaluation of alternatives.
* Cannot identify assumptions or biases.
* Reasoning is disorganized, unsupported, or absent.
