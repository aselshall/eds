## Teaching Philosophy 

1. Design a course with **real-world context** through exposing the students to cognitively complex problems with interdisciplinary connections, which require higher order thinking and elaborate communication of ideas and findings
2. Deliver a **research-oriented class** by (i) designing class projects in which students will be required to collect data to answer a research question, solve a design problem, or find management solutions, and (ii) bringing my research into the classroom to illustrate the application of theories and methods to real life applications, to make the class more enjoyable
3. Enhance the **experiential-learnin opportunities** for students through inviting guest speakers and conducting field trips with prospective employers if possible, which can be rewarding experiences for the students
4. Provide a **demand-driven education** as driven by the job market and graduate-study opportunities through (i) providing the students with the technical tools for analyzing and solving multidisciplinary and complex real-world problems, (ii) helping the students to develop their analytical, writing, and communication skills, and (iii) getting the students to acquire soft skills such as the ability to prioritize and function both independently and collaboratively, willingness to plunge into unfamiliar disciplines, and willingness to take risks by exploring and testing new ideas
5. Form a **student-centered learning** environment through group discussion, group problem solving exercises, and the use of digital dynamic courseware platforms (e.g., TopHat, Google Forms, Kahoot, etc.)
6. Create an **inclusive and supportive environment** through (i) employing techniques to show the students that we care about them and about their learning, (ii) adapting the learning environment to the students’ needs through learning about the students’ backgrounds, goals, and expectations from day one and during the course through surveys and exit tickets, (iii) working closely with students and monitoring their progress to ensure that students with various skills, aptitudes, and attitudes will benefit most from the course and develop accordingly, and (iv) giving student equal access to learning such that diverse backgrounds, goals, and expectations of the students are respected and valued.
