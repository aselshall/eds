Concerns:
- Some students find the pace of the class too fast, particularly for beginners, suggesting a need for more time spent on basics.
  - **Response**:
    - I did not want to spend more time on basics of Python because I want to have time for the more interesting materials in the course.
    - In the future, I may allocate more time to basics. 
- One student feels overwhelmed by the amount of information presented in a single class, leading to difficulty in following along.
   - **Response**: Please try to review the material before class as this might help 
- While explanations are appreciated, there's a desire for a balance between thoroughness and pacing.
  - **Response**: This is a good suggestion. However, I try my best to present the minimum material that you need to use this tool. I will spend more time on this.   
- Some students find homework assignments lengthy and challenging, occasionally needing external assistance.
  - **Response**:
    - Please do the assignment part by part after each class.
- Clearer instructions and guidance are requested for certain assignments, particularly when the tasks are more complex.
  - **Response**:
    - Check exercise before solving the homework and ask the instructor for help.
    - I will provide additional guidance for challenging assignments.
- One student has classes during office hours
  -**Response**: Please note that office hours are also by appointment.
