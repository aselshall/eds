The JupyterHub server is now ready for you to begin using.

To access, simply go to: 69.88.163.33:8001 while connected to fgcu-campus or eduroam wifi networks (only).

Currently there is an issue with something behind the scenes that will cause your browser to say the website is unsafe, but by clicking “Advanced” (or similar) and “Proceed…” (or similar), this error can be bypassed. The website is in fact safe, and we are working to resolve this issue.
