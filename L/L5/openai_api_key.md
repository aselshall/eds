### What is OpenAI API?
OpenAI API is a tool that provides access to language models such as ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4, and more importantly allows users to integrate these AI capabilities into their applications. In that case that would be your JupyterLab and Python.

### What is OpenAI API Key ?
The OpenAI API Key is a special code that grants users access to the OpenAI API, allowing them to interact with  the language models of OpenAI such as ChatGPT 3.5 through programming. This code is like a password, so you should not share this code with anyone.

OpenAI offers both free and paid plans for using the API.  Users can access the API for free with limited features during a trial period, after which they can choose a paid plan based on their usage needs. The charge for the paid services, such as ChatGPT 4, is based on usage rate, while using the free services like ChatGPT 3.5 may incur minimal or no charges. Additionally, new users will have a free trial period without needing to provide credit card information.
