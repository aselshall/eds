## Course Description

Welcome to the Environmental Data Science course. This course serves as an introduction to scientific data analysis using Python, a dynamic programming language with rich scientific computing libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Xarray, and Cartopy. Throughout this course, you will not only learn these libraries but also learn how to leverage Python for the analysis and visualization of environmental and water resources data. We will explore various data sources and formats, utilizing specialized resources tailored to your interests, such as Google Earth Engine, CMIP6 datasets, and FloPy. Additionally, you will receive an introduction to the application of machine learning techniques to environmental datasets, employing Python libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

This course is designed for engineering and science students, who are interested in, have a practical need for, or want to expand their skills in environmental data analysis using Python. No prior programming experience is required.

This course is project-based and with self-directed learning opportunities. Accordingly, hands-on learning and practical applications are key criteria for assessing and evaluating your progress in environmental data analysis using Python.

- Assignments 30%
- Project 30%
- Fina Exam 30%

General notes
- Grades Due from Faculty by Tuesday, 07 May 2024
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop.
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

## Participation and Attendance

### Participation
For participation assessment students are expected to:
- arrive on time, and attend everyclass for the entire class period
- actively participate in discussions_without_ being called upon by the instructor. Questions in class and office hours are highly encouraged
- be present in class, meaning avoid web browsing, texting, off subject discussions, or other non-academic activities that impact your class participation grade
- read assigned materials _before_ class to prepare for discussion and to incorporate what is learned from the readings in the class discussion
- fill-out exit ticket meaningfully to provide instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions

All these will be evident by the quality of your class participation, which form the majority of your participation grade.  

**Specific notes:**
- Let the instructor know at the beginning of class if you anticipate an event (e.g., emergency phone call, appointment) that will disrupt the class activities.
- Two warnings regarding engaging in non-class related activities will be counted as one absence.  
  
### Attendance Policy
Regular attendance in classes is expected.
- Notify instructor if you anticipate missing class.
- Students are responsible for any missed material or changes in assignments, times, dates, or due dates announced in class.
- Unavoidable absences do not excuse students from responsibility for course material.
- Attendance will be monitored using "sign-in sheet" for each class meeting.
- It is the responsibility of the student to sign-in during each class attended.
- A student is considered absent if his or her signature does not appear on the sign-in sheet.
- Forgery of signatures on a sign-in sheet is a violation of university Academic Integrity Policies and subject to disciplinary action.

### Tardiness Policy
- Each two instances of excessive tardiness (\> 5 minutes) will count as one absence.
- Two instances of leaving class early will also count as one absence.

### Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

### Absences and Final Grade Policy
Unexcused absences affect the final course grade according to the following schedule:

| Absences | Effect on final grade |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 2 Absences | No effect on final grade |
| 3 Absences | Final grade lowered by half later grade (e.g., from A to A-) |
| 4 Absences | Final grade lowered by a one full letter grade (e.g., from A to B) |
| 5 or more absences | Final grade of 0 assigned (Official withdrawal recommended) |

## Assignments

You learn a programming language by practice. Accordingly, almost a bi-weekly assignment will be posted on Canvas. Each assignment is due by Thursday at 11:59 pm, unless otherwise mentioned in class or posted on CANVAS. Assignments are designed to include self-directed learning opportunities. This is to give you the opportunity to explore and experiment with a variety of Python libraries and datasets of your interest.

## Project

A main learning objective is to immerse students in a project-based learning experience that integrates practical skills with a scientific mindset and engineering design approach. You are expected to work individually or in a group of two or three to develop a research question or industry-oriented problem, and use python tools to process data to provide useful information and solutions that support decisions. The project objectives are to help you to build a deeper understanding of different Python libraries and their applications in water resources and environmental data analysis, while promoting independent learning and critical thinking skills. By achieving these objectives, you will be well-equipped to leverage Python for in-depth analysis of environmental data across various domains. The instructor will be available to provide guidance and support. In addition, you will share your discoveries with the class through a presentation. A rubric for class presentation will be posted on Canvas. Attending all presentations and providing peer-assessment using the peer-assessment form that will be posted on canvas consist part of your project grade. Due dates for project abstract, interim report, and final report will be posted on Canvas. If you have a group of two or three students, a peer-assessment rubric will be posted on Canvas. The project will be graded according to the following schedule

Project assessment plan
- Abstract 10%
- Interim report 10%
- Project presentation 20%
- Peer-assessment 10%
- Final report 50%

## Late Assignments and Project Policy
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

## Exam
- There will be a final exam that is comprehensive and open-book
- Makeup exam may be provided for [execused absence](#Execused-Absence-Policy)

## Academic Behavior Standards and Academic Dishonesty  
- Familiarize yourself with the [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/) that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations.
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission, and will be strictly addressed in line with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf).
- Zero tolerance is enforced, and such behavior is extremely disruptive.

## Financial Aid Statement

As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. The confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

## LLM use

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gimini, Claude, and DeepL should not be used in assignments and exams when indicated by the text "LLM Not Permitted". Students must cite the used LLM tool, and failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty. Check FGCU Generative AI policy for more details.

## Core Syllabus Policies 

FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these [online](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)
